\chapter{Introduction}

This document describes the physical background, derivation of the formulas and the calculations of the app Slackforce. The app includes the following three main functionalities:

\begin{description}
	\item[Measure Force:] Measures the pretension of the slackline from the sound you hear when slapping the line with your finger.
	\item[Static Calculations:] Calculates the forces on the Line at static conditions resulting from the geometric setup of the line.
	\item[Dynamic Simulation:] Simulates the movement of the line and the forces involved in bouncing or jumping.
\end{description}

This document contains three chapters corresponding to the named app functionalities. Note that there might be errors in the presented formulas. Use the formulas careful and do not fully trust the calculated values. The creator of this document is not responsible for any harm resulting from the use of the presented calculations and formulas.
