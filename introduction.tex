\chapter{Introduction}

This document describes the physical background and derivation of the formulas and calculations of the App Slackforce. The App has the following three main functionalities:

\begin{description}
	\item[Measure Force:] Measure the pretension of the slackline from the sound you get after slapping the line with your finger.
	\item[Static Calculations:] Calculate the Forces on the Line at static conditions from the geometric properties of the line.
	\item[Dynamic Simulation:] Simulate the movement of the line and the forces involved in dynamic moves like bouncing or jumping.
\end{description}

This document is structured in three chapters corresponding to the named app functionalities. Note that there might be errors in the presented formulas. So use the formulas careful and do not trust the calculated values. The creator of this document is not responsible of any harm resulting from the use of the presented calculations and formulas.
