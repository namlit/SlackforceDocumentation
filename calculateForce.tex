\chapter{Calculate Force}

The idea of calculating forces is to use the geometric information of the line and a known force to calculate unknown forces with simple vector algebra. If the tension of the line at a given sag is known the tension at a different sag can easily be calculated from the stretch behavior.

\section{Basics} \label{sec:basics}

\begin{figure}[htb] \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/slacklineWithForces.pdf}
	\caption{Schematical slackline with horizontal and vertical components of force}
	\label{fig:slacklineWithForces}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:slacklineWithForces} shows a schematical slackline with a given length and sag. As you can see it is possible to divide the force that affects the anchor of the line into a horizontal and a vertical component. The forces of the left part of the line will look the same. The total force will be the sum of forces on the left and the right side. So the horizontal components will eliminate each over and the vertical ones get added. If a slackliner is standing on the line the total vertical force have the amount corresponding to the slackliner's weight. From the geometric properties shown in figure \ref{fig:slacklineWithForces} the following equation can easily get extracted:


\begin{equation}
	\frac{F_a}{0.5\cdot F_v} = \frac{l_1}{s} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{l^2}{4} + s^2}}{s^2}
\end{equation}

Together with the gravity acceleration $g = 9.81\frac{m}{s^2}$ and the weight of the slackliner $m$ this leads to the following four equations:

\begin{spreadlines}{1.5\baselineskip}
\begin{align}
	F &= \frac{\sqrt{s^2 + \frac{l^2}{4}}}{2\cdot s} \cdot m\cdot g \label{eqn:calcForce} \\
	m &= \frac{2\cdot s\cdot F}{g\cdot\sqrt{s^2 + \frac{l^2}{4}}} \label{eqn:calcWeight} \\
	s &= \sqrt{ \frac{m^2\cdot l^2\cdot g^2}{4\cdot(4F^2 - m^2g^2)} } \label{eqn:calSag} \\
	l &= \sqrt{ \frac{4\cdot s\cdot (4F^2 - m^2g^2)}{m^2g^2} } \label{eqn:calcLength} 
\end{align}
\end{spreadlines}

With Equation \ref{eqn:calcForce} - \ref{eqn:calcLength} it is possible to calculate any of the parameters force, weight of slackliner, sag and length if the other parameters are known.

\section{Calculating the Pretension}

\begin{figure}[htb] \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/forceStretchDiagram.pdf}
	\caption{Force-Stretch-Diagramm of a 100\,m Type 18 Line with 4,5\,kN Pretension}
	\label{fig:forceStretchDiagramm}
\end{figure}

If you know the tension with a person and the stretch behavior of a line it is possible to calculate the pretension. Figure \ref{fig:forceStretchDiagramm} shows the stretch behavior of a Type 18 MKII line. Is can be seen that the stretch is not linear. To get the pretension of the line you need to know the increase of length $\Delta l$ due to the sag of the line. This can be calculated with the following formula:

\begin{equation}
	\Delta l = 2\cdot l_1 - l= 2\cdot \sqrt{s^2+\frac{l^2}{4}} - l
	\label{eqn:deltaL}
\end{equation}

To get the pretension you have to do the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Calculate the anchor force with a slackliner on the line
	\item read the corresponding stretch from the force-stretch-diagram
	\item calculate the new stretch with formula \ref{eqn:deltaL}
	\item read the pretension from the force-stretch-diagram
\end{enumerate}

If a linear stretch behavior $\frac{\Delta l}{l} = \alpha\cdot F$ is assumed it is possible to put that relation into an analytic formula:

\begin{equation}
	F = F_0 + \frac{2\cdot \sqrt{s^2+\frac{l^2}{4}} - l}{\alpha\cdot l}
\end{equation}

However, the App always uses the force-stretch-diagram as the results are better with that method. The diagram is interpolated linear between the provided data points. So the accuracy always depends on the number of available data points.

\section{Rodeo Lines}

Rodeo Lines are slacklines a lot of sag and no pretension. So the pretension $F_0$ is always zero and the line has an initial sag $s_0$ without any slackliner on the line. When a slackline steps on the line, it might stretch further and lead to a sag greater than the initial sag. Figure \ref{fig:RodeoLineWithForces} shows the forces on an rodeo line.

\begin{figure}[htb] \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/rodeoLineWithForces.pdf}
	\caption{Schematical rodeo line with horizontal and vertical components of force}
	\label{fig:RodeoLineWithForces}
\end{figure}

As it can be seen there is no change to the static forces with a slackliner on the line from figure \ref{fig:slacklineWithForces}. So all the calculations of section \nameref{sec:basics} are still valid. If you want to do calculations based on the force-stretch-diagram you have to be aware the equation \ref{eqn:deltaL} now changes to

\begin{equation}
	\Delta l = 2\cdot (l_2 - l_2) = 2\cdot \left( \sqrt{s^2+\frac{l^2}{4}} - \sqrt{s_0^2+\frac{l^2}{4}}\right)
	\label{eqn:deltaLRodeo}
\end{equation}

In addition there is no pretension to calculate, but you can calculate the initial sag of the line using the force-stretch-diagram. Therefore you have to read the stretch from the diagram and use the following formula:

\begin{align}
	s_0 &= \sqrt{l_1^2 - \frac{l^2}{4}} = \sqrt{\left(l_2-\Delta l\right)^2 - \frac{l^2}{4}} \\
	&= \sqrt{\left( \sqrt{s^2 + \frac{l^2}{4}}  -\Delta l\right)^2 - \frac{l^2}{4}}
\end{align}

\section{Calculating Slackline Forces from the Pretension}

Unfortunately it is very difficult for linear stretch behavior and impossible for a custom stretch behavior to get an analytic expression of the slackline forces dependent on the pretension. Therefore some kind of approximation algorithm has to be used. The App is currently using the Illinois algorithm, that seems to work quite well.

\section{Slackliner not in the middle of the Line (not implemented yet)}

In the following it is assumed that the slackliner is standing at position $p \in [0,1]$ on the line. The forces always get calculated for the left anchor point. The forces at the right anchor point equal the forces at the left anchor point at position $1-p$. Figure \ref{fig:slacklineWithForcesUnsymmetric} shows the forces on this new setup. If the slackliner is not moving to the left or right the horizontal forces have to be the same on both sides. That leads to different vertical forces and anchor forces on both sides.

	\end{subfigure} \par\bigskip

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Force Components on Unsymmetric Conditions }
	\label{fig:slacklineWithForcesUnsymmetric}
\end{figure}

From the geometrical properties follows

\begin{equation}
	\frac{p\cdot l}{s} = \frac{F_{h,l}}{F_{v,l}} = \frac{ \sqrt{F_{a,l}^2 - F_{v,l}^2 }}{F_{v,l}}
	\label{eqn:geometricPropertiesUnsymmetric}
\end{equation}

The the total vertical Force is still the sum of both sides:

\begin{equation}
	F_v = F_{v,l} + F_{v,r}
	\label{eqn:verticalForce}
\end{equation}

The equality of the horizontal forces leads to

\begin{equation}
	\frac{p\cdot l}{s}\cdot F_{v,l} = \frac{(1-p)\cdot l}{s}\cdot F_{v,r} 
	\label{eqn:horizontalEquality}
\end{equation}

The combination of equation \ref{eqn:horizontalEquality} and \ref{eqn:verticalForce} gives

\begin{equation}
	F_{v,l} = (1-p)\cdot F_v
	\label{eqn:leftVerticalForce}
\end{equation}

Inserting equation \ref{eqn:leftVerticalForce} in \ref{eqn:geometricPropertiesUnsymmetric} gives the final equation

\begin{equation}
	F_{a,l} = \frac{(1-p)\cdot F_v}{s}\cdot \sqrt{(p\cdot l)^2 + s^2}
\end{equation}

For $p = 0.5$ this equation is similar to equation \ref{eqn:calcForce} from the previous section. Note that equation \ref{eqn:deltaL} now changes to

\begin{equation}
	\Delta l = \sqrt{ (p\cdot l)^2 + s^2 } + \sqrt{ (1-p)^2 l^2 + s^2 } - l
\end{equation}
